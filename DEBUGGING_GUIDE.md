## Debugging Guide for Pagination Issue

Follow these steps to identify what's happening:

### 1. Open Browser Developer Console
- Open your browser's developer console (F12)
- Go to the Console tab

### 2. Test the Issue
1. **Apply a filter** that reduces contacts to around 100
2. **Remove all filters** 
3. **Watch the console output**

### 3. What to Look For

Look for these console messages and note the values:

#### When applying filters:
```
🔍 applyFiltersAndSorting called
📊 Total contacts before filtering: [SHOULD BE TOTAL COUNT]
🔧 Current filters: [SHOULD SHOW YOUR FILTER]
🔧 Filter [field] [operator] [value]: [before] → [after]
📊 Final filtered result count: [SHOULD BE ~100]
📄 Pagination update - Current total: [old] → New total: [new]
```

#### When removing filters:
```
🗑️ Removing filter at index: [index]
🗑️ Current filters before removal: [SHOULD SHOW FILTERS]
🗑️ Filters after removal: [SHOULD BE EMPTY ARRAY]
🔄 Reactive trigger fired:
  - filters: [SHOULD BE EMPTY ARRAY]
🔍 applyFiltersAndSorting called
📊 Total contacts before filtering: [SHOULD BE TOTAL COUNT]
🔧 Current filters: [SHOULD BE EMPTY]
📊 Final filtered result count: [SHOULD EQUAL TOTAL CONTACTS]
📄 Final pagination state: {currentPage: 1, totalPages: [CALCULATED], totalRecords: [TOTAL], pageSize: 250}
```

### 4. Key Questions

**Question 1**: What is the "Total contacts before filtering" number? This should be your actual total contact count.

**Question 2**: When you remove all filters, what is the "Final filtered result count"? This should equal the total contacts.

**Question 3**: What is the "Final pagination state" after removing filters?

### 5. Possible Issues

If the numbers don't match expectations:

- **If "Total contacts before filtering" is 100**: The issue is in data fetching
- **If "Final filtered result count" is 100 after removing filters**: The issue is in filter removal logic
- **If pagination state is wrong**: The issue is in pagination update logic

### 6. Next Steps

Based on the console output, we can identify:
1. Whether the data is loading correctly
2. Whether filters are being removed properly
3. Whether pagination is updating correctly

Report back with the console output and we can pinpoint the exact issue!
