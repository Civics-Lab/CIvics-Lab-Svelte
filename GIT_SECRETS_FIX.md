# Git Secrets Fix

## Issue
The previous commit contained sensitive SendGrid API keys in the documentation files, preventing the commit from being pushed to GitHub.

## Solution
1. **Removed sensitive information** from `SENDGRID_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
2. **Replaced actual API key** with placeholder text
3. **Added instructions** for users to replace placeholders with their own values

## Files Fixed
- `SENDGRID_SETUP_GUIDE.md`: Removed actual SendGrid API key, replaced with `your_sendgrid_api_key_here`

## Next Steps
After fixing the secrets:
1. Stage the fixed files: `git add .`
2. Amend the previous commit: `git commit --amend -m "Update invite system implementation (secrets removed)"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push --force-with-lease origin main`

## Prevention
To prevent this in the future:
- Never include actual API keys, passwords, or secrets in documentation
- Use placeholder values like `your_api_key_here` 
- Consider adding a pre-commit hook to scan for secrets
- Review commits before pushing to ensure no sensitive data is included

The invite system implementation is complete and ready for use once SendGrid is properly configured.
