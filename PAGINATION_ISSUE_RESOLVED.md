# Pagination Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Identified
The pagination was showing "Showing 1 to 100 of 100 results" because:

1. **API Limit**: The `/api/contacts` endpoint had a default limit of 100 contacts
2. **No Navigation Controls**: Since 100 contacts with page size 250 = 1 page, navigation controls weren't shown

## Root Cause
In `/src/routes/api/contacts/+server.ts`:
```typescript
const limit = limitParam ? parseInt(limitParam, 10) : 100; // Default limit of 100
```

The API was only returning the first 100 contacts from the database, not all contacts.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Contact Service
Modified `/src/lib/services/contactService.ts` to request a higher limit:

```typescript
// OLD
const response = await fetch(`/api/contacts?workspace_id=${workspaceId}`);

// NEW  
const response = await fetch(`/api/contacts?workspace_id=${workspaceId}&limit=10000`);
```

### 2. Fixed Pagination Logic
The pagination update logic in `applyFiltersAndSorting()` was already correct and working properly.

### 3. Cleaned Up Debug Code
Removed all debugging console logs and reverted temporary changes.

## Results
Now when you:
1. **Load the page**: You'll see all your contacts (up to 10,000)
2. **Apply filters**: Pagination updates correctly to show filtered count
3. **Remove filters**: Pagination restores to show full contact count
4. **See navigation controls**: When you have more than 250 contacts, you'll see previous/next buttons

## Expected Behavior
- With 100 contacts: "Showing 1 to 100 of 100 results" (no nav controls - this is correct)
- With 500 contacts: "Showing 1 to 250 of 500 results" (with nav controls)
- With 1000+ contacts: Full pagination with multiple pages

## Performance Note
The 10,000 limit should handle most workspaces. If you need more than 10,000 contacts, consider implementing proper server-side pagination using the existing `fetchPaginatedContacts` function.

## Test the Fix
1. Refresh your contacts page
2. Check if you now see more than 100 contacts
3. Apply and remove filters to verify pagination updates correctly
4. If you have 250+ contacts, verify navigation controls appear
