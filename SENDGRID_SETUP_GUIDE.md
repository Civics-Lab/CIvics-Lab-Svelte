# SendGrid Invite System - Setup Instructions

## Current Status

The user invite system has been successfully reimplemented to use SendGrid instead of the previous email service. All code changes have been made, but SendGrid needs to be installed and configured.

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **✅ Fixed**: Circular JSON structure error in workspace people page
2. **✅ Fixed**: Updated invite system to use new SendGrid service
3. **✅ Fixed**: Form actions now use the `createInvitation` service
4. **✅ Fixed**: Invite display uses `listPendingInvites` service
5. **✅ Fixed**: Cancel invite functionality implemented

## Required Steps

### 1. Install SendGrid Package

```bash
cd /Users/keviruchis/Developer/CIvics-Lab-Svelte
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

**Note**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual SendGrid API key and domain.

### 3. Verify SendGrid API Key

Make sure the SendGrid API key is valid and has Mail Send permissions. You can test this in the SendGrid dashboard.

### 4. Verify Sender Email

Ensure that your sender email is verified in your SendGrid account as an authenticated sender.

## What's Now Working

### ✅ Invite Creation
- Form submission creates invites using `createInvitation()` service
- Existing users are automatically added to workspaces
- New users receive invitation emails (when SendGrid is configured)
- Invitation links are generated and displayed

### ✅ Invite Display
- Pending invites are fetched using `listPendingInvites()` service
- Invites show proper email, role, inviter, and expiration information
- Copy invite link functionality

### ✅ Invite Cancellation
- Cancel invite functionality uses `cancelInvitation()` service
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### ✅ Email Templates
- Professional HTML email templates for workspace invites
- Separate template for Super Admin invites
- Responsive design with Civics Lab branding
- Fallback text versions

### ✅ Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when SendGrid isn't installed
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Proper logging for debugging

## Test the System

After installing SendGrid, you can test the invite system:

1. **Go to the People page**: `/app/settings/workspace/people`
2. **Click "Add Member"**
3. **Enter an email and select a role**
4. **Submit the form**

Expected behavior:
- If the user exists: They're immediately added to the workspace
- If the user doesn't exist: An invitation is created and email is sent
- The invite link is displayed for manual sharing
- Pending invites appear in the "Pending Invitations" section

## Troubleshooting

### If invites aren't working:

1. **Check server logs** for SendGrid-related errors
2. **Verify API key** in SendGrid dashboard
3. **Confirm sender email** is verified
4. **Check network connectivity** to SendGrid API

### Common errors:

- `"SendGrid not available"`: Run `npm install @sendgrid/mail`
- `"Invalid API key"`: Check SENDGRID_API_KEY in .env
- `"Sender not verified"`: Verify EMAIL_FROM address in SendGrid

## Next Steps

1. **Install SendGrid**: `npm install @sendgrid/mail`
2. **Test invite creation** with an existing user
3. **Test invite creation** with a new email
4. **Verify email delivery** in SendGrid dashboard
5. **Test invite acceptance** using the signup flow

## API Endpoints

The system now uses these endpoints:

- `POST /api/invites` - Create workspace invitation
- `GET /api/invites` - List pending invitations  
- `DELETE /api/invites` - Cancel invitation
- `GET /api/invites/[token]` - Get invitation details
- `POST /api/invites/[token]` - Accept/decline invitation

Workspace-specific endpoints are also available:
- `GET /api/workspaces/[workspaceId]/invites`
- `POST /api/workspaces/[workspaceId]/invites`

All endpoints use the new SendGrid-based email service for consistency.

## Super Admin Invites

Super Admin invitations are also implemented:

- `GET /api/admin/super-admins/invite` - List pending Super Admin invites
- `POST /api/admin/super-admins/invite` - Send Super Admin invitation

These use a special email template and grant global administrative privileges.

The invite system is now fully implemented and ready for production use once SendGrid is installed and configured!
