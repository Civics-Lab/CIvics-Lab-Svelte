# Workspace Creation Flow

This document explains the updated workspace creation flow that prompts users to create and name a workspace rather than automatically generating one.

## Overview

When a user signs up or logs in without a workspace, they'll now be presented with a dedicated workspace creation screen that allows them to:

1. Learn what a workspace is
2. Choose to create a workspace
3. Name their workspace according to their needs

## Implementation Details

### 1. Signup Flow

- When a new user completes signup, they are now redirected to `/app?create=workspace` if they don't have any accepted invites
- The `create=workspace` parameter triggers the automatic display of the workspace creation form
- Users with accepted invites will still be redirected directly to their workspace

### 2. Empty Workspace State

- The app layout checks if the user has any workspaces
- If no workspaces are found, the `EmptyWorkspaceView` component is displayed
- This component provides context about what a workspace is and guides the user to create one

### 3. Manual Workspace Creation

- Users must explicitly create and name a workspace
- The API no longer automatically generates a "My Workspace" workspace
- This gives users more control and understanding of the workspace concept

## Components

1. **EmptyWorkspaceView.svelte**
   - Displays when a user has no workspaces
   - Explains what a workspace is
   - Provides a form to create and name a workspace
   - Shows success message and redirects after creation

2. **App Page Logic**
   - Checks for workspaces on load
   - Conditionally shows EmptyWorkspaceView or normal app content
   - Handles query parameters for automatic form display

## API Changes

1. **Workspace API**
   - No longer automatically creates a default workspace
   - Returns an empty array when no workspaces exist
   - Still handles workspace creation via the POST endpoint

2. **Auth Service**
   - No longer creates a default workspace during signup
   - Simplifies the signup process to only handle invites

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Better User Understanding**
   - Users explicitly learn what a workspace is
   - They make a conscious choice to create one
   - They can name it according to their specific needs

2. **Clearer Onboarding**
   - The separate workspace creation step helps with user orientation
   - Users don't end up with a "My Workspace" they didn't create
   - Better for multi-workspace users

3. **More Intentional Setup**
   - Users start with a workspace they named themselves
   - Reduced confusion about what workspaces are and how they work

## Testing

To test this new flow:

1. Create a new user account with no invites
2. Verify you're redirected to the workspace creation view
3. Create a workspace and confirm it appears correctly
4. Logout and login again to verify normal app access
