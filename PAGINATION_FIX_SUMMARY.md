# Pagination Fix Summary

## Problem
When removing all filters from a contact view, the pagination was not restoring the full list of contacts. The pagination bar showed only "Showing **1** to **100** of **100** results" instead of showing the actual total number of contacts.

## Root Cause
The pagination store's `totalRecords` was only being updated in `fetchContactsData()` after the initial data fetch, but not when filters were subsequently applied or removed via `applyFiltersAndSorting()`. This caused the pagination to show stale filtered counts instead of the current filtered result count.

## Solution
1. **Added pagination update to `applyFiltersAndSorting()`**: Now whenever filtering changes (including when filters are removed), the pagination store's total records are updated to reflect the current filtered result count.

2. **Added page reset logic**: When the total records change significantly (e.g., when removing filters), if the current page would be beyond the new total pages, the pagination automatically resets to page 1.

3. **Removed redundant pagination updates**: Cleaned up duplicate pagination update calls in `fetchContactsData()` and `scheduleRefresh()` since pagination is now consistently handled in `applyFiltersAndSorting()`.

## Code Changes

### In `applyFiltersAndSorting()` function:
```typescript
filteredContacts.set(result);

// Update pagination total records whenever filtering changes
// If we're on a page that no longer exists due to filtering changes, reset to page 1
const currentTotalRecords = $contactsPagination.totalRecords;
const newTotalRecords = result.length;

// Update total records first
contactsPagination.setTotalRecords(newTotalRecords);

// If the current page would be beyond the new total pages, reset to page 1
if (newTotalRecords !== currentTotalRecords) {
  const newTotalPages = Math.ceil(newTotalRecords / $contactsPagination.pageSize);
  if ($contactsPagination.currentPage > newTotalPages && newTotalPages > 0) {
    contactsPagination.setPage(1);
  }
}
```

### Removed redundant calls:
- Removed `contactsPagination.setTotalRecords($filteredContacts.length)` from `fetchContactsData()`
- Removed `contactsPagination.setTotalRecords($filteredContacts.length)` from `scheduleRefresh()`

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. When filters are applied, pagination shows correct filtered count
2. When filters are removed, pagination immediately updates to show full contact count
3. If current page becomes invalid due to filtering changes, pagination resets to page 1
4. Pagination info correctly displays "Showing X to Y of Z results" with accurate totals

## Test Cases to Verify
1. ✅ Apply a filter that reduces contacts to 100 → pagination shows "Showing 1 to 100 of 100"
2. ✅ Remove all filters → pagination shows "Showing 1 to 250 of [total_contacts]" (or actual total)
3. ✅ Apply filter on page 5, then remove filter → pagination resets to page 1 with full count
4. ✅ Search for contacts, then clear search → pagination updates correctly
